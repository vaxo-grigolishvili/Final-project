                    <h2> THE BUGGIE THAT AMAZED THE STREETS OF CASILDA</h2>
                     <p> Before finishing high school, Horacio had the chance to build with his own hands a four-wheeled vehicle. A company in Mar del Plata in fact offered a plastic body kit, reinforced with fiberglass, to be adapted to the frame of another car: in Argentina, the vehicle was known as Dune-Buggie. Horacio was immediately captured by the new challenge.
        
                        He launched himself into the project and wasted no time in buying the bodywork. At a scrapyard he found a Renault Dauphine, in bad condition and with a broken engine. History was repeating again. From that moment on, all his energies were concentrated on his new adventure, which exceeded, in effort and complexity, the one that saw him struggling with the bike.</p>

                    <h2> THE FIRST F2</h2>
                    <p>The job took over a year and something like five thousand hours of work were invested in the project. The vehicle was completed and presented at a dinner that counted over 300 people, including journalists from the specialized press of the city of Rosario, entrepreneurs, technicians and fanatics of the races.

                        The Pagani F2 was finally a reality and seemed born under a lucky star. Finding a pilot for the new Pagani F2 was not a problem. With Augustín Beamonte, F2 champion, it was love at first sight. They signed a verbal agreement and informed the sports press.</p>
