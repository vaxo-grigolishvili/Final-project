                    <p> Born from the passion of a little boy, the Zonda C12 is the first Pagani supercar to be constructed at the atelier of San Cesario sul Panaro. The bodywork, inspired to the Silver arrows of the Mercedes C group, encloses the essence of an unmistakable wind, where art and science beautifully combine to create a unique symphony, fascinating and bewildering at the same time.</p>
